Prototype declaration fix by Pain of Dungeon Eternal

Final Battle door lock fix by kevL's
v.160904
The script locks the door but doesn't make sure it's shut first. This shuts the door and locks it.

- O_X2
o08_a_battle.NSS


Lizardfolk Warrior fix by kevL's
v.180214
This lizard should not drop its Claw and Bite creature-weapons. The fix here gives its blueprint Creature Weapon Proficiency.

Goodie (diary) fix by kevL's
v.180228
One of the goodies that appear randomly on the OverlandMap is a diary. Unfortunately the placeable is flagged static and it doesn't have an OnUsed script. So, while it appears on the OL like any other goodie, the PC can't activate it to get a reward. This fix removes the static-flag, enables the usable-flag, and assigns it the standard OnUsed script for goodies.

More Lizardfolk fixes by kevL's
v.180303
Lizardmen shouldn't drop their claws. This gives them Creature Weapon Proficiency so they'll equip their claws and keep them equipped instead. Same with the umberhulk thrall creature.

Teamwork Training fixes by kevL's
v.180406
The script (m_c_tw_rush) that checks prerequisites for Team Rush should require that the pc-speaker has *both* the Toughness feat AND Survival skill 8+. The script (m_c_tw_cob) that checks prerequisites for Circle of Blades should require that the pc-speaker has *both* BAB 6+ AND Weapon Specialization (any melee). The script (m_c_tw_foe) that checks prerequisites for Foe Hunting should require that other party-members have *both* BAB 4+ AND Survival skill 1+; also allow Favored Enemy Plant to satisfy pc-speaker prerequisite. The script (m_c_teamwork) that checks if Circle of Blades has already been trained also mistakenly checked that Superior Flank had not been trained yet (note: this script may clash with an alternate method using global_ints that also get used to check if a particular Teamwork feat has been trained - usage seems arbitrary). Daerred's dialog (m11_daerred) was missing several navigation nodes (these were fixed by someone else and I only include the file here). Candril's dialog (m11_candril) referenced a non-existent script (m_c_trance_prereq) and is properly 'm_c_tw_trance' (this was fixed by someone else and I only include the file here).
