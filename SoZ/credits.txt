Final Battle door lock fix by kevL's
v.160904

Goodie (diary) fix by kevL's
v.180228
One of the goodies that appear randomly on the OverlandMap is a diary. Unfortunately the placeable is flagged static and it doesn't have an OnUsed script. So, while it appears on the OL like any other goodie, the PC can't activate it to get a reward. This fix removes the static-flag, enables the usable-flag, and assigns it the standard OnUsed script for goodies.

More Lizardfolk fixes by kevL's
v.180303
Lizardmen shouldn't drop their claws. This gives them Creature Weapon Proficiency so they'll equip their claws and keep them equipped instead. Same with the umberhulk thrall creature.
